# CBZ to PDF converter

One of the many scripts I write meaninglessly to solve these problems enjoyably. 

This script was originally motivated by the want to read comics in **Amazon Kindle**. 
Currently, Amazon Kindle does not support **cbz/cbr**, making it a hassle to directly
read comics from the Kindle. However, some workarounds are sufficient for doing so, and
this script aims to solve exactly that.
